##Problem:
A Tilt user really loves all the Tilt platform features, but would like to have a landing page. The landing page could be customized with a logo and a unique design.
He/She comes to you and asks you to develop the landing page.

##Tilt page URL: https://www.tilt.com/tilts/lets-get-allysa-to-the-rio-olympics

These are his/her requirements:
The page should display the Olympics logo on the top right of the page http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8a1813ebb675372564938ce7419479a3.jpg

Under the logo, display the Title, and the description of the Tilt (consider SEO for your tags)

Every time the page is loaded, the page should fetch the data from the API located at this URL https://www.tilt.com/tilts/lets-get-allysa-to-the-rio-olympics/stats.json

Once all the data is loaded, display the number of contributions and the amount raised in US dollars.

####Bonus point:
Add a countdown timer to the page

Technical requirement:
You can use any language to develop this page
Send us back the code on a Github repository
